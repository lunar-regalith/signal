# Signal
Generated by [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo) 7.4.4.

## Getting Started
To build this library, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "Signal.rbxmx"
```

## How To Use
First, we use the Signal ModuleScript's RemoteEvent function to tell it we want a RemoteEvent.
```luau
-- CLIENT-SIDE --
local ReplicatedStorage = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"))

-- The ModuleScript should be in ReplicatedStorage, because both the Client and Server need to be able to load it.
local Signal = require(ReplicatedStorage.Signal)

-- The RemoteEvent function tells the ModuleScript to find an instance of it in ReplicatedStorage.
-- If the requested RemoteEvent doesn't exist, it creates one with Instance.new() and re-parents it.
local MyRemoteEvent = Signal.RemoteEvent("MyRemoteEvent")

-- The return value of Signal.RemoteEvent() is just that, a RemoteEvent.
-- It returns the Instance if it finds it, or returns the creaated Instance after re-parenting.
MyRemoteEvent:FireServer("Hello, World!")
```
In effect, it's just a Module with a couple of functions for dynamically initializing RemoteEvents without a lot of fuss.

```luau
-- SERVER-SIDE --
local ReplicatedStorage = require(game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage"))

local Signal = require(ReplicatedStorage.Signal)

local MyRemoteEvent = Signal.RemoteEvent("MyRemoteEvent")

MyRemoteEvent.OnServerEvent:Connect(function(...: any)
  print(...)
end)
```
